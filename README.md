# This is a project submission for Advanve Linux Commands

In this project, I learnt differnt Linux Commands. I have mastered and advanced in my Linux commands. I learnt how to create groups and users as well as how to give them the right to either read, write or execute. 

In this task I would be practicing some of the advanced linux commands and I will also be attaching some images to record my progress. 

The first task is to create a group on the server and name it 'devops'
The command for this is 'sudo groupadd devops'
